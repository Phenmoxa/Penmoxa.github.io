<p>Stargate atlantis was started as Stargate SG-1 was entering it's it's 8th season and follows a while new Sg team to a far away galaxy called the Pegasus Galaxy. The team after a mind blowing battle in the antarctic discover a weapons platform that has a new address in it which is 8 chevrons instead of the traditonal 7 Chevrons. They are finally able to dial it up with the help of a Zero Point Module or ZPM, which is an ancient device that has great amounts of energy capable of sending people accross vast distances such as galaxy to galaxy.</p>
<p>Atlantis was submerged when they arrived and well later on in the series we learn that the was a fail safe installed by the first leader of the Atlantis expadition. They awaken a race called the Wraith who are life sucking aliens accidentally engineered by the "Ancients" and over the series are trying to find a way to take over atlantis and find their way to earth.</p>
<p>Another antagonist of the story are the replicators who the "Ancients" created as tiny nanites that can take human form or really any form they want. They become a big threat in the third season but the SG team finds a way to put an end to their terror but not without loosing an important team member </p>
